# Kanen
Meteor-Svelte starter package

# Overview
This starter package is the outcome of work done to build an application system for both a software-as-a-service and for real time control (IoT if you prefer).  This package provides a scaffolding structure to quickly build pages and includes a variety of components to add page specific functionality.  This package is a partial port from a Meteor-Vue application in an attempt to reduce the bundle size and improve Time To First Byte (TTFB).

This Meteor-Svelte Starter Package is built on the most current technologies as of 2020 using the latest releases of Meteor MongoDb Svelte and Bulma.
It is also an opinionated view of the work that needs to get done.  This package is clearly not for everyone nor does it try to accommodate the latest new ideas.  This package is meant for business people / product managers that need to get outcomes quickly and can scale during the initial growth phase of a company.

We hope you find this package useful to jump start your exploration of Svelte running on Meteor.
